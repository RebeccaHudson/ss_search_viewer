     <p>On the front page, it would be helpful to explain the title of the
      database and state that it works exclusively for humans.</p>
<p>
    @SNP DB provides statistical evaluation of impact of SNPs on transcription
    factor-DNA interactions based on position weight matrices (PWM).
    The current version is built on SNPs from dbSNP Build 144 for the
    human genome assembly GRCh38/hg38. atSNP DB uses in silico
    calculations based on the statistical method in Zuo et al.,
    Bioinformatics (2015).
    atSNP first-time users can start scanning vast amounts of
    SNP-PWM combinations with two key features:
</p>          



            
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li> p-values quantifying the impact of SNP on the PWM matches (p-value rank)</li>
<li> composite logo plots</li>
</ul>
<p>
   @SNP identifies and quantifies best matches to the transcription
   factor PWMs with both the reference and the SNP alleles in a small
   window around the SNP location (up to +/- 30 base pairs and considering
   subsequences spanning the SNP position). It evaluates statistical
   significance of scores on each allele and calculates statistical
   significance of the score difference between the reference and the SNP alleles.
</p>
<p>
  The discovery of best matches on the reference and SNP alleles are
   conducted separately, thus genomic subsequences providing the best matches
   with both alleles may be different. The change in goodness of match between
   both alleles indicates impact of SNPs on transcription factor binding ability
   to DNA. @SNP also provides a composite logo plot for easy visualization
   of the quality of the reference and SNP allele matches to the PWM and the
   influence of SNPs on the match change. Read more under "Help".
